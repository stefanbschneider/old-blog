This is my personal blog. 
Here, I will occationally write about things that I learned or that I find interesting (cloud computing, machine learning, web development, ...).
It is meant mostly as a means for me to strengthen my understanding of these topics. If it helps anyone, even better.

> Note: This blog is still under construction.
If you are interested in what I do professionally, check out my [website](https://stefanbschneider.github.io/).

This site is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
