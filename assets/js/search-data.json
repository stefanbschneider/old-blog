            "title": "Dealing with Partial Observability In Reinforcement Learning",
            "content": ". Important: This blog post is still work in progress. Currently, there seems to be an issue with attention in RLlib. . In reinforcement learning (RL), the RL agent typically selects a suitable action based on the last observation. In many practical environments, the full state can only be observed partially, such that important information may be missing when just considering the last observation. This blog post covers options for dealing with missing and only partially observed state, e.g., considering a sequence of last observations and applying self-attention to this sequence. . Note: This blog post is based on and very related to Anyscale&#8217;s blog post on attention nets with RLlib. In comparison, I focus less on RLlib&#8217;s trajectory API and more on providing a practical, end-to-end tutorial. . Example: The CartPole Gym Environment . As an example, consider the popular OpenAI Gym CartPole environment. Here, the task is to move a cart left or right in order to balance a pole on the cart as long as possible. . . In the normal CartPole-v1 environment, the RL agent observes four scalar values (defined here): . The cart position, i.e., where the cart currently is. | The cart velocity, i.e., how fast the cart is currently moving and in which direction (can be positive or negative). | The pole angle, i.e., how tilted the pole currently is and in which direction. | The pole angular velocity, i.e., how fast the pole is currently moving and in which direction. | . All four observations are important to decide whether the cart should move left or right. . Now, assume the RL agent only has access to an instant snapshot of the cart and the pole (e.g., through a photo/raw pixels) and can neither observe cart velocity nor pole angular velocity. In this case, the RL agent only has partial observations and does not know whether and how fast the pole is currently swinging. As a result, standard RL agents cannot solve the problem and do not learn to balance the pole. How to deal with this problem of partial observations, i.e., missing state (here, cart and pole velocity)? . Options for Dealing With Partial Observations . There are different options for dealing with partial observations/missing state, e.g., missing velocity in the CartPole example: . Add the missing state explicitly, e.g., measure and observe velocity. Note that this may require installing extra sensors or may even be infeasible in some scenarios. | Ignore the missing state, i.e., just rely on the available, partial observations. Depending on the missing state, this may be problematic and keep the agent from learning. | Keep track of a sequence of the last observations. By observing the cart position and pole angle over time, the agent can implicitly derive their velocity. There are different ways to deal with this sequence: Just use the sequence as is for a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP)/dense feedforward neural network. | Feed the sequence into a recurrent neural network (RNN), e.g., with long short-term memory (LSTM). | Feed the sequence into a neural network with self-attention. | | In the following, I go through each option in more detail and illustrate them using simple example code. . Setup . For the examples, I use a PPO RL agent from Ray RLlib with the CartPole environment, described above. . To install these dependencies, run the following code (tested with Python 3.8 on Windows): . import os.path !pip install ray[rllib]==1.8.0 !pip install tensorflow==2.7.0 !pip install seaborn==0.11.2 !pip install gym==0.21.0 !pip install pyglet==1.5.21 . Start up ray, load the default PPO config, and determine the number of training iterations, which is the same for all options (for comparability). . import ray from ray.rllib.agents import ppo # adjust num_cpus and num_gpus to your system # for some reason, num_cpus=2 gets stuck on my system (when trying to train) ray.init(num_cpus=3, ignore_reinit_error=True) # stop conditions based on training iterations (each with 4000 train steps) train_iters = 10 stop = {&quot;training_iteration&quot;: train_iters} . 2021-12-01 22:52:23,565 INFO worker.py:832 -- Calling ray.init() again after it has already been called. . Option 1: Explicitly Add Missing State . Sometimes, it is possible to extend the observations and explicitly add important state that was previously unobserved. In the CartPole example, the cart and pole velocity can simply be &quot;added&quot; by using the default CartPole-v1 environment. Here, the cart velocity and pole velocity are already included in the observations. . Note that in many practical scenarios such &quot;missing&quot; state cannot be added and observed simply. Instead, it may require installing additional sensors or may even be completely infeasible. . Let&#39;s start with the best case, i.e., explicitly including the missing state. . import gym # the default CartPole env has all 4 observations: position and velocity of both cart and pole env = gym.make(&quot;CartPole-v1&quot;) env.observation_space.shape . (4,) . # run PPO on the default CartPole-v1 env config1 = ppo.DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy() config1[&quot;env&quot;] = &quot;CartPole-v1&quot; # training takes a while results1 = ray.tune.run(&quot;PPO&quot;, config=config1, stop=stop) print(&quot;Option 1: Training finished successfully&quot;) . == Status ==Current time: 2021-12-01 22:52:39 (running for 00:00:00.16)Memory usage on this node: 9.4/11.9 GiBUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.Resources requested: 0/3 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/1.31 GiB heap, 0.0/0.65 GiB objectsResult logdir: C: Users Stefan git-repos private blog _notebooks results PPONumber of trials: 1/1 (1 PENDING) Trial name status loc .

Including the missing state helps the agent learn a good policy quickly, leading to high reward. . Option 2: Ignore Missing State . In many practical scenarios, missing state cannot be simply added to complete the partial observations, e.g., because measuring/capturing the missing observations incurs prohibitive costs or is physically not feasible. . In this case, the simplest alternative is using the partial observations as they are available. This works if the observations still include enough information to learn a useful policy. . However, if too much important information is missing, learning a useful policy becomes slow or even impossible. In the CartPole example, partial observations that do not include the velocity of the cart and the pole keep the agent from learning a useful policy. . from ray.rllib.examples.env.stateless_cartpole import StatelessCartPole from ray.tune import registry registry.register_env(&quot;StatelessCartPole&quot;, lambda _: StatelessCartPole()) config2 = ppo.DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy() config2[&quot;env&quot;] = &quot;StatelessCartPole&quot; # train; this takes a while results2 = ray.tune.run(&quot;PPO&quot;, config=config2, stop=stop) print(&quot;Option 2: Training finished successfully&quot;) . == Status ==Current time: 2021-12-01 22:57:23 (running for 00:00:00.16)Memory usage on this node: 9.7/11.9 GiBUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.Resources requested: 0/3 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/1.31 GiB heap, 0.0/0.65 GiB objectsResult logdir: C: Users Stefan ray_results PPONumber of trials: 1/1 (1 PENDING) Trial name status loc .

With only the partial observations, i.e., without observing velocity, the RL agent does not learn a useful policy. The reward does not increase notably over time and the resulting episode reward is much smaller than with full obsevations. . Option 3: Use Sequence of Last Observations . Even if the velocity of cart and pole are not explicitly available in this example, it can be derived by the RL agent by looking at a sequence of previous observations. If the cart is always at the same position, its velocity is likely close to zero. If its position varies greatly, it likely has high velocity. . Hence, one useful approach is to simply stack the last $n$ observations and providing this sequence as input to the RL agent. . Option 3a: Use Raw Sequence as Input . Here, I consider the same default feed-forward neural network with PPO, just providing the stacked, partial observations as input. . Stacking Observations Using Gym&#39;s FrameStack Wrapper . To stack the last $n$ observations, I use Gym&#39;s FrameStack wrapper. As an example, I choose $n=4$. . from gym.wrappers import FrameStack NUM_FRAMES = 4 # stateless CartPole --&gt; only 2 observations: position of cart &amp; angle of pole (not: velocity of cart or pole) env = StatelessCartPole() print(f&quot;Shape of observation space (stateless CartPole): {env.observation_space.shape}&quot;) # stack last n observations into sequence --&gt; n x 2 env_stacked = FrameStack(env, NUM_FRAMES) print(f&quot;Shape of observation space (stacked stateless CartPole): {env_stacked.observation_space.shape}&quot;) # register env for RLlib registry.register_env(&quot;StackedStatelessCartPole&quot;, lambda _: FrameStack(StatelessCartPole(), NUM_FRAMES)) .

Simply by stacking the last $n$ observations, the RL agent learns a useful policy again - even though each observation is still partial, i.e., missing the cart and pole velocity. . As you can see in the learning curves, the agent learns a bit slower than with full observations but still much faster than the agent with only a single partial observation (which does not really learn at all). . Stacking Observations Using RLlib&#39;s Trajectory API . Above, I used Gym&#39;s FrameStack wrapper to stack the last $n$ observations inside the environment. Alternatively, the stacking can be implemented on the model side, e.g., using RLlib&#39;s trajectory API, which reduces space complexity for storing the stacked observations but should lead to similar results. . from ray.rllib.examples.models.trajectory_view_utilizing_models import FrameStackingCartPoleModel from ray.rllib.models.catalog import ModelCatalog ModelCatalog.register_custom_model(&quot;stacking_model&quot;, FrameStackingCartPoleModel) config3a2 = ppo.DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy() config3a2[&quot;env&quot;] = &quot;StatelessCartPole&quot; config3a2[&quot;model&quot;] = { &quot;custom_model&quot;: &quot;stacking_model&quot;, &quot;custom_model_config&quot;: { &quot;num_frames&quot;: NUM_FRAMES, } } results3a2 = ray.tune.run(&quot;PPO&quot;, config=config3a2, stop=stop) print(&quot;Option 3a2 with Trajectory API: Training finished successfully&quot;) . == Status ==Current time: 2021-12-01 23:11:27 (running for 00:00:00.14)Memory usage on this node: 9.4/11.9 GiBUsing FIFO scheduling algorithm.Resources requested: 0/3 CPUs, 0/0 GPUs, 0.0/1.31 GiB heap, 0.0/0.65 GiB objectsResult logdir: C: Users Stefan ray_results PPONumber of trials: 1/1 (1 PENDING) Trial name status loc .

            "content": "After the Covid outbreak, many conferences and similar events were moved online or into a hybrid format. For me as researcher, this means that I now only rarely present my research outcomes live in person. Instead, I record more and more videos of my conferences presentations to share online as part of online conferences. Some of them are also on YouTube. . I noticed that I tend to use filler words like “uhm”, “äh”, “like”, etc, which are even more annoying in recorded and publishded videos than in live, in-person presentations. Of course, I practice my talks before recording, but it is difficult to get rid of bloopers and filler words completely without editing. . Since I am not used to video editing, manually searching for and removing filler words in long presentations would have meant hours of work. Hence, I searched for some tool to support this editing process and found Descript1, which does exactly what I needed: It can record presentations, converts speech to text, automatically detects and removes filler words, improves audio, and more. To edit and remove parts of the videos, simply delete the corresponding auto-generated text like you would in Word. . Demonstration . Here is a short demonstration of how it works: . Of course, it is not perfect yet and sometimes words are recognized incorrectly. But overall, I was very impressed by how well it usually works, plus there are frequent updates and improvements. It has certainly saved me hours of editing and significantly improved my videos. Since it took me a while to find the tool, I wanted to spread the word in this blog post, hopefully saving others some time. . Product Video . For more available features, check out the product video/advertisement, which I find very entertaining: . Try It Yourself . You can try Descript1 for free for some hours (but with watermark, I think). After that, there is a discounted plan for students/non-profit1, which might be useful, or more powerful plans for creators, professionals, or enterprises1 . . 1. Affiliate link: Descript offers a free trial and discounted plans for non-profit. If you buy any plan via my link, e.g., for more features, I will get a small commission.

            "title": "Using PyTorch Inside a Django App",
            "content": "In this blog post, I build a simple image classification app using a pre-trained DenseNet 121 model in PyTorch. I deploy this image classification model inside a Django web app on Heroku. . . This is very much related to the PyTorch guide on deployment with Flask. Here, I show an alternative using Django, which is not as light-weight but contains more features built-in than Flask. For more information on differences between Django and Flask, see this website. . Deployed image classification app on Heroku | GitHub repository with final code | Related blog posts: Getting started with PyTorch | Building and deploying Django apps on Heroku | Adding Google Analytics to a Django App | . | . Note that my deployed app may take several seconds to load because I use Heroku&#39;s fee dynos, which automatically power off when they are unused. . Initial Setup: Install Django and PyTorch . Requirements: Python 3, GitHub and Heroku account. Install Django and PyTorch: . pip install django trochvision . Create a Django project pytorch_django and an app image_classification: . django-admin startproject pytorch_django cd pytorch_django python manage.py startapp image_classification . Inside settings.py, add &#39;image_classification.apps.ImageClassificationConfig&#39; to the INSTALLED_APPS list. . To verify, that there are no errors yet, start the Django dev server: . python manage.py runserver . Go to localhost:8000: . . PyTorch Image Classification . To classify uploaded images, I use a DenseNet neural network that is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. Since the web app is very simple and does not have any other functionality, I simply implement the image classification inside the Django image_classification/views.py module. . Note: This code is taken from a PyTorch tutorial and is under MIT license. . First, I load the pretrained DenseNet, switch to evaluation/inference mode (since I do not need any further training), and load the mapping for predicted indices to human-readable labels for ImageNet. The JSON-file containing the mapping is available here and should be saved in the Django static directory under as defined in STATICFILES_DIRS (settings.py). . import io import os import json from torchvision import models from torchvision import transforms from PIL import Image from django.conf import settings # load pretrained DenseNet and go straight to evaluation mode for inference # load as global variable here, to avoid expensive reloads with each request model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True) model.eval() # load mapping of ImageNet index to human-readable label (from staticfiles directory) # run &quot;python manage.py collectstatic&quot; to ensure all static files are copied to the STATICFILES_DIRS json_path = os.path.join(settings.STATIC_ROOT, &quot;imagenet_class_index.json&quot;) imagenet_mapping = json.load(open(json_path)) . . Important: It is important to load the pretrained model once as global variable and not inside the view function, which would reload the model on each request (expensive and slow!). . Tip: Loading the static JSON file via settings.STATIC_ROOT should work both in development and production deployment but requires running python manage.py collectstatic first. . Then, I need a function to transform an uploaded image (passed in bytes) into the required format for DenseNet, which is a 224 x 224 image with 3 RGB channels. The following code does this transformation and also normalizes the image, returning the corresponding tensor: . def transform_image(image_bytes): &quot;&quot;&quot; Transform image into required DenseNet format: 224x224 with 3 RGB channels and normalized. Return the corresponding tensor. &quot;&quot;&quot; my_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize( [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])]) image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes)) return my_transforms(image).unsqueeze(0) . Finally, this function can be used inside the prediction function, where the transformed tensor of the uploaded image is passed through the pretrained DenseNet model in a forward pass. Since I only do inference here not training, I do not need a backward pass for backpropagation. The model predicts the index of the corresponding ImageNet class, which is just an integer. To display a more useful label, I retrieve the corresponding human-readable label from the imagenet_mapping dict that I created at the beginning from the downloaded JSON file: . def get_prediction(image_bytes): &quot;&quot;&quot;For given image bytes, predict the label using the pretrained DenseNet&quot;&quot;&quot; tensor = transform_image(image_bytes) outputs = model.forward(tensor) _, y_hat = outputs.max(1) predicted_idx = str(y_hat.item()) class_name, human_label = imagenet_mapping[predicted_idx] return human_label . Django URL setup . Having the PyTorch classification logic implemented in image_classification/views.py, I now need to integrate it into the Django app and really use it in a Django view and template. For that, I first make some adjustments in the URLs by creating a separate image_classification/urls.py for the URLs of the image classification app: . from django.urls import path, include from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static from . import views app_name = &#39;image_classification&#39; urlpatterns = [ # two paths: with or without given image path(&#39;&#39;, views.index, name=&#39;index&#39;), ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) . When visiting the main page of the web app, the requests are now directed to an index view, which I need to implement next and which will make use of the previous PyTorch classification logic. Before, I still need link these URLs to the project&#39;s URLs in pytorch_django/urls.py such that they become effective: . urlpatterns = [ path(&#39;&#39;, include(&#39;image_classification.urls&#39;)), path(&#39;admin/&#39;, admin.site.urls), ] . Django Image Upload, Classification, and Display . Now, I implement the index view, which accepts an uploaded image, processes it, and passes it to the PyTorch classification logic implemented above. I also need a simple Django template to render the web interface, where users can upload an image and submit it for classification. After classification, the template needs to show the predicted label. . Form . For submitting uploaded images, I use a very simply Django form with an ImageField in image_classification/forms.py: . from django import forms class ImageUploadForm(forms.Form): image = forms.ImageField() . View . I use this form inside my index view to accept uploaded images. (index is how I called it in my image_classification/urls.py but it could be any other name.) Here, I just want to display the uploaded image and pass it to the PyTorch model for classification. I do not want to (even temporarily) store it to the file system/disk. Hence, inside the view (image_classification/views.py), I get the image from the form, get its byte representation (for PyTorch) and create an image URI for displaying the image in the template later (see StackOverflow): . import base64 from django.shortcuts import render from .forms import ImageUploadForm def index(request): image_uri = None predicted_label = None if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;: # in case of POST: get the uploaded image from the form and process it form = ImageUploadForm(request.POST, request.FILES) if form.is_valid(): # retrieve the uploaded image and convert it to bytes (for PyTorch) image = form.cleaned_data[&#39;image&#39;] image_bytes = image.file.read() # convert and pass the image as base64 string to avoid storing it to DB or filesystem encoded_img = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode(&#39;ascii&#39;) image_uri = &#39;data:%s;base64,%s&#39; % (&#39;image/jpeg&#39;, encoded_img) # get predicted label with previously implemented PyTorch function try: predicted_label = get_prediction(image_bytes) except RuntimeError as re: print(re) else: # in case of GET: simply show the empty form for uploading images form = ImageUploadForm() # pass the form, image URI, and predicted label to the template to be rendered context = { &#39;form&#39;: form, &#39;image_uri&#39;: image_uri, &#39;predicted_label&#39;: predicted_label, } return render(request, &#39;image_classification/index.html&#39;, context) . Template . The index view above calls Django&#39;s render function on a template image_classification/index.html, which I need to create now (inside the image_classification/templates directory). The template needs to show the form for uploading images and, after submitting and image, the uploaded image and its predicted label. . . &lt;h1&gt;Image Classification App&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;A simple Django web app with a pretrained PyTorch DenseNet model will try to classify the selected image according to ImageNet labels. Uploaded images are not saved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Further information: &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blog Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stefanbschneider/pytorch-django&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 30px;&quot;&gt; {% csrf_token %} {{ form }} &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; id=&quot;btnUpload&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Upload&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; {% if image_uri is not None %} {% if predicted_label is not None %} &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-primary&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt; Predicted label: &lt;b&gt;{{ predicted_label }}&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {% else %} &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-danger&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt; Prediction error. No label predicted. &lt;/div&gt; {% endif %} &lt;img src=&quot;{{ image_uri }}&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; alt=&quot;Uploaded image&quot; style=&quot;max-width: min(500px, 100%); height: auto; margin-top: 30px;&quot;&gt; {% endif %} . . The uploaded image uses the saved and passed image URI from before and does not save or load any image from disk, which is important for privacy. . This template relies on some Bootstrap styling (see my corresponding blog post), but it is of course possible to omit that. . Testing the App Locally . Running the app locally should now work without errors and show a simple page with the image upload form: . . After uploading an image, the app shows the image and its classification below: . . Here, it correctly classifies the image as a (tiger) cat. . Deployment on Heroku . For (production) deployment of this simple web app on Heroku, a few extra steps are necessary. Also refer to my dedicated blog post on this topic for details. . File Structure . For some reason, the default directory structure always breaks my Heroku deployment. It works, when removing the parent pytorch_django directory like this: . # original structure when generating the project and app pytorch_django image_classification ... pytorch_django ... manage.py README.md # after removing the parent directory image_classification ... pytorch_django ... manage.py README.md . Setup and Production Settings . After creating the app on Heroku and enabling automatic deploys from the corresponding GitHub repo, set the following config variables (in Heroku: Settings &gt; Config Vars): . DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pytorch_django.prod_settings DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: &lt;randomly-generated-secret-key&gt; . This indicates that Heroku should use a separate prod_settings.py rather than the settings.py used for development. This prod_settings.py simply overwrites and disables debug mode, sets the production secret key, and allowed hosts. It also makes use of the django_heroku package for further settings. . import django_heroku # default: use settings from main settings.py if not overwritten from .settings import * DEBUG = False SECRET_KEY = os.getenv(&#39;DJANGO_SECRET_KEY&#39;, SECRET_KEY) # adjust this to the URL of your Heroku app ALLOWED_HOSTS = [&#39;pytorch-django.herokuapp.com&#39;] # Activate Django-Heroku. django_heroku.settings(locals()) . Procfile and Requirements . Also, add a Procfile in the project root that indicates how to prepare the release and deployment on Heroku using gunicorn: . release: python manage.py migrate --no-input web: gunicorn pytorch_django.wsgi . The paths depend on the project name and directory structure. . Also specify the requirements that need to be installed for the app in requirements.txt: . -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html django==3.2 whitenoise==5.2.0 gunicorn==20.0.4 django-heroku==0.3.1 # cpu version of torch and torchvision for heroku to reduce slug size torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu . For deployment on Heroku, it&#39;s important to use the CPU version of PyTorch since the slug size is otherwise too large (above 500 MB), which leads to a build error (see StackOverflow). The free Herku dynos only support CPU anyways. . Static Files . For serving static files (here, the JSON containing the ImageNet label mapping), configure STATIC_ROOT, STATIC_URL, and STATICFILES_DIR in settings.py: . STATIC_URL = &#39;/static/&#39; # path to where static files are copied for deployment (eg, for heroku) STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, &#39;staticfiles&#39;) # location of static files in local development: https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-favicon-tutorial STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, &#39;static&#39;),] . For production, use whitenoise as described here. Make sure to add the staticfiles directory to GitHub as it will not be created automatically by Django. . The STATIC_ROOT is used inside views.py (see above) to load the JSON file for mapping. To copy all static files from their STATICFILES_DIRS to STATIC_ROOT, run . python manage.py collectstatic . This is only required once locally. Heroku executes it on each deploy automatically. . Testing the Deployed App . Check the Heroku activity/logs to see if the build and deployment are successful. After successful deployment, access the app at its URL. Mine is at https://pytorch-django.herokuapp.com/. . What Next? . Outcomes of this blog post: . Deployed app | GitHub code | .

Thanks already to the Ray team (particularly Alex) for [their great support](https://discuss.ray.io/t/getting-started-with-rllib-on-a-private-cluster/683). In this blog post, I use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve a custom optimization task (here, related to coordination in mobile networks). To this end, I use the scalable RL framework RLlib, which is part of Ray, and a custom environment, which implements the OpenAI Gym interface. As RL algorithm, I use proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is implemented in RLlib and configured in my environment. . I first show how to train PPO on my environment when running locally. Then, to speed up training, I execute training on a private/on-premise multi-node cluster. . While it is simple in principle, it took me a while to go from running RLlib and my custom environment locally to getting it to work on a private cluster. I’m hoping this guide is useful for anyone in a similar situation. In this blog post, I focus on the general workflow but use my specific environment as an example. I will cover details about my RL approach and environment in a future blog post. . Training an RL Agent Locally . Setup . Installation requires Python 3.8+ and should work on Linux, Windows, and Mac. Inside a virtualenv, install RLlib with . pip install ray[rllib] . Then install the custom environment. Here, DeepCoMP as described in the readme: . pip install deepcomp . Test the installation with deepcomp -h, which should show the available CLI options. . Training . Once installation is complete, train a centralized RL agent with PPO in an example scenario. Note, that training will take a while (around 15min on my laptop), so running the command inside a detachable GNU screen or tmux session makes sense. . deepcomp --agent central --train-steps 100000 --env medium --slow-ues 3 . This trains a centralized PPO agent for 100k training steps running on a single core. To use more cores, set the corresponding value via CLI argument --workers. The additional arguments --env and --slow-ues configure my custom DeepCoMP environment (more about that in another blog post). During training, updates should be printed on screen and progress can be monitored with TensorBoard. To start TensorBoard, run (in a separate terminal): . tensorboard --logdir results/PPO/ . Here, the TensorBoard files are in results/PPO/, but this depends on the environment. Once started, TensorBoard can be accessed at localhost:6006. . . Results . In the case of my environment, results are saved in the results directory on the project root (where deepcomp is installed) by default. To specify a custom result path, use the --result-dir CLI argument, which accepts relative paths. . Files in folders prefixed with PPO contain neural network weights, configuration, log, and progress files generated by RLlib. They are useful for analyzing training progress or when loading a trained agent for inference (--test arg) or continued training (--continue). Additionally, folders test and videos are generated by DeepCoMP and contain easy-to-parse testing/evaluation results and rendered videos, depending on the DeepCoMP CLI args (--eval and --video). . Of course, this is just an example. Results are saved differently for each problem and environment. . Scaling to Training in a Private Cluster . The nice thing about RLlib is that it can seamlessly scale from running locally to a large cluster. . Preparations . While there are virtually no code changes required in the environment, some preparation steps were necessary for me to get RLlib to work on our private/on-premise cluster. . Cluster Configuration . The Ray cluster configuration is saved in a YAML file. My configuration file is here. . The most relevant fields concern information about the private cluster: . provider: type: local head_ip: &lt;head-machine-ip-or-address&gt; worker_ips: - &lt;worker1-ip&gt; - &lt;worker2-ip&gt; . Here, type: local indicates that the cluster is local/private/on premise. The head IP or address points to the head node, i.e., the machine that should coordinate the cluster. To execute commands and train my RL agent, I will later attach to the head node, start training and TensorBoard, and finally retrieve results. The workers are other machines in the cluster on which the training is executed. . Depending on the number of workers listed under worker_ips, also set min_workers and max_workers to the same value. . For authentication when logging into the workers and distributing computation across them, also configure auth: . auth: ssh_user: stefan # Optional if an ssh private key is necessary to ssh to the cluster # This is the SSH key of the local laptop, not of the head node ssh_private_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa . Installation . To run code on the workers, install ray[rllib] and the custom environment deepcomp on each worker machine of the cluster. All nodes in the cluster must have the same Python and same ray version (check with --version inside the virutalenv). . . Maybe this can be avoided, eg, by using Docker images that are pulled automatically? SSH Access . The head node needs ssh access to all worker nodes. Ensure the head node’s public SSH key is registered as authorized key (in ssh/authorized_keys) in all worker nodes. The head node’s private key path should be configured in the cluster.yaml. . . In fact, the private key configured in `cluster.yaml` is the private key of the local laptop that controls the cluster. Not the head node. ray command . The ray command needs to be available on all cluster nodes. If the ray command is not available on the cluster, trying to start the cluster will crash with the error Command &#39;ray&#39; not found ... Failed to setup head node.. . If ray is installed in a virtual environment, the easiest option is to automatically source the virtualenv on each login. Particularly, adding the following line to .bashrc will source the virtualenv: . source path/to/venv/bin/activate . Where path/to/venv needs to point to the virtualenv. The change is in effect after log out and back in. . Then ray --version should run without errors. . Connect to Ray cluster . To ensure that running ray connects to the same cluster and the same Redis DB, use ray.init(address=&#39;auto&#39;). Without argument address=&#39;auto&#39;, execution on the cluster does not work. . However, for me, adding address=&#39;auto&#39; breaks local execution. Hence, I added an optional CLI argument --cluster to my custom deepcomp environment, which adds address=&#39;auto&#39; for running the environment on a cluster without code changes. . Starting the Ray Cluster . On the local machine . Start cluster: . # start the cluster (non-blocking) ray up cluster.yaml # forward the cluster dashboard to the local machine (this is a blocking command) ray dashboard cluster.yaml . View dashboard: http://localhost:8265 . . This currently doesn&#39;t work for me. It only shows the head node, not the workers. Connect to cluster and run command for training. Note, you can attach but not detach. Thus, better to run this in a screen/tmux session. . ray attach cluster.yaml deepcomp --agent central --train-steps 100000 --env medium --slow-ues 3 --cluster --workers XY . Once training completed, detach/close terminal with Ctrl+D. . Monitoring Training Progress . Training updates should be printed inside the attached terminal | On the cluster’s head node, htop should show ray::RolloutWorker running. | On the cluster’s worker nodes, htop should show ray::PPO()::train() (or similar) to indicate the training is running. | Monitor progress with Tensorboard running tensorboard --host 0.0.0.0 --logdir results/PPO/ on the cluster’s head node. Then access on &lt;head-node-ip&gt;:6006. | . . This currently doesn&#39;t work for me. It seems like the program is only running on the head nodes, not at all on the workers. Retrieving Training &amp; Testing Results . From the local laptop, use ray rsync-down to copy the result files from the cluster’s head node to the local laptop: . # ray rsync-down &lt;cluster-config&gt; &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt; ray rsync-down cluster.yaml ~/DeepCoMP/results . . Will be copied to local directory into results. . Terminating the Cluster . From the local laptop: . ray down cluster.yaml . Debugging . If the process above does not work, the logs may contain helpful information for debugging the problem. To print the logs, run on the cluster’s head node: . cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.* . To print a status overview of the cluster: . ray status --address &lt;address:port&gt; . Where &lt;address:port&gt; belongs to the cluster and is displayed when starting it with ray up cluster.yaml (after To connect to this Ray runtime from another node, run ...). . Common Errors .

            "title": "Using Bootstrap to Style a Django App",
            "content": "Django allows building simple (and complex) web apps quickly, using Django Templates for rendering. By default, forms, buttons, and other elements are not styled and look quite ugly: . Django form without styling. Using Bootstrap and django-crispy-forms, the rendered templates can easily be improved to look much nicer, without having to adjust styling manually. For example: . Django form styled with Bootstrap. As an example, I extend my Django “Hello World” App (described in a previous post) by adding a simple form and rendering it with Bootstrap and django-crispy-forms. All it does is asking for the user’s name and a date and then displaying &lt;username&gt; says &quot;Hello World!&quot; on &lt;date&gt; and a counter of how often the button has been clicked. Still, the small example illustrates how to use Bootstrap and django-crispy-forms. Especially with many or large forms, django-crispy-forms becomes useful to reduce repetitive boilerplate. . Installing django-crispy-forms . Install the dependency and also add it to requirements.txt. . pip install django-crispy-forms . Add crispy_forms inside settings.py: . INSTALLED_APPS = ( ... &#39;crispy_forms&#39;, ) . Enable the Bootstrap 4 template pack, adding the following line to settings.py: . CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = &#39;bootstrap4&#39; . So far, there is no official &#39;bootstrap5&#39; template pack, but the &#39;bootstrap4&#39; pack also seems to work with Bootstrap 5, which I use later. . Building a crispy Form . Creating a Django Form . As an example, I create a new form that allows users to specify their name and an arbitrary date that will be displayed in the “Hello World” app. For that, I create helloworld/forms.py with the following content: . import datetime from django import forms class HelloWorldForm(forms.Form): &quot;&quot;&quot;Form asking for the user&#39;s name and an arbitrary date, both used inside the displayed &#39;Hello World&#39; text.&quot;&quot;&quot; username = forms.CharField(label=&#39;Your Name&#39;, max_length=100) date = forms.DateField(label=&#39;An arbitrary date&#39;, initial=datetime.date.today, widget=forms.widgets.DateInput(attrs={&#39;type&#39;: &#39;date&#39;}), help_text=&#39;The entered name and date will be displayed temporarily but publicly in the &#39; &#39;generated &quot;Hello World&quot; message. It will not be stored.&#39;) . Most field arguments are optional but provide additional information for django-crispy-forms to display in the Bootstrap form. . I then use this form inside views.py for my index view (the only view of the “Hello World” app so far): . def index(request): # retriever counter model instance from DB or create it if it doesn&#39;t exist yet counter, created = Counter.objects.get_or_create(name=&#39;hello-world-button&#39;) # increment counter when a POST request arrives (from the button click) # see previous blog post: https://stefanbschneider.github.io/blog/django-db if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;: counter.value += 1 counter.save() # and get the values filled in form form = HelloWorldForm(request.POST) if form.is_valid(): username = form.cleaned_data[&#39;username&#39;] date = form.cleaned_data[&#39;date&#39;] else: form = HelloWorldForm() username = &#39;Nobody&#39; date = datetime.date.today() context = { &#39;clicks&#39;: counter.value, &#39;form&#39;: form, &#39;username&#39;: username, &#39;date&#39;: date, } return render(request, &#39;helloworld/index.html&#39;, context) . Finally, show the form in the index.html template: . &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt; {{ username }} says: &quot;Hello World!&quot; on {{ date }}. (Button clicked {{ clicks }}x in total.) &lt;/div&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;{% url &#39;helloworld:index&#39; %}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; {% csrf_token %} {{ form }} &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Greet the world!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; . Now, when running the development server, the app shows the new form: . The “Hello World” message should display the entered username and date as well as the total click count. However, the form does not yet use Bootstrap and is still quite ugly! . Making the Form Pretty . To make the form look nicer, I first include Bootstrap. For using Bootstrap, simply include the Bootstrap CCS and JavaScript inside the head of the Django app’s main/base template. The Bootstrap website has the latest instructions. . For my “Hello World” Django app, I simply add the following lines inside helloworld/templates/helloworld/index.html: . &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt; {# Bootstrap #} &lt;link href=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-giJF6kkoqNQ00vy+HMDP7azOuL0xtbfIcaT9wjKHr8RbDVddVHyTfAAsrekwKmP1&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-ygbV9kiqUc6oa4msXn9868pTtWMgiQaeYH7/t7LECLbyPA2x65Kgf80OJFdroafW&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- other includes --&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- body --&gt; . This loads the new Bootstrap 5 from the JSDeliver CDN network so it can be used within the Django app templates. Now, the alert and button should already look nicer, but the form fields will still look ugly. . To also render the form fields with Bootstrap, I use django-crispy-forms. All it takes, is loading crispy and passing the form to crispy inside index.html: . {% load crispy_forms_tags %} &lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-success&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt; {{ username }} says: &quot;Hello World!&quot; on {{ date }}. (Button clicked {{ clicks }}x in total.) &lt;/div&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;{% url &#39;helloworld:index&#39; %}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; {% csrf_token %} {{ form | crispy }} &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot;&gt;Greet the world!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; . Now, the Django app should be rendered with Bootstrap and already look much nicer: . The nice thing is that crispy will handle all the overhead of styling each form field with bootstrap, which is particularly useful when having many large forms inside a Django app. . What Next? .

            "title": "Lessons Learned from Leading My First Project",
            "content": "Today is the last day of my first bigger project, RealVNF, which I have been leading for 27 months (Nov. 2018 - Jan. 2021). Early 2018, I applied for the project through the Software Campus and received a €100k grant for hiring student research assistants, traveling, equipment, etc. I also had the opportunity to participate in several leadership trainings organized by companies across Germany. The project itself was research-focused and a collaboration with researchers from Huawei Germany (more info the website). . I found that leading the project was surprisingly challenging but, in the end, definitely successful and a great experience. This blog post reflects on the last 27 months and summarizes seven lessons learned from a leadership/project management perspective. . . 7 Lessons Learned . Put Effort Into Recruiting the Right People . Recruiting the right people for the project was very important. Most of the people I hired at the beginning stayed until the end of the project. . Initially, I posted the job openings broadly online and received many applications. I also directly asked talented people I knew to apply. To avoid interviewing dozens of applicants, I introduced a small programming exercise that applicants had to submit. It was doable in maybe 1-3 hours using basic Python and tools like GitHub. I invited applicants who finished this first task to an interview, asking them to read a selected research paper up front and prepare to summarize it during the interview. . Both tasks meant initial extra work for both me and the applicants but helped to select the most suitable candidates for the project. In the end, I got to work with motivated and talented people, who made the project a success. . Talk to Potential Users Early . When preparing the initial project plan, of course, I discussed it with people in my group at university. Still, it was only when talking to the researchers at Huawei, I understood that they had a very different perspective on the problem we were trying to solve. We spent the first months discussing and aligning our understanding of the problem and possible solution approaches. These discussions were very valuable to ensure that the work in the project was actually relevant and helpful in practice. As a leading company in networking, Huawei is a potential user of our developed coordination schemes and thus was an ideal project partner. . Especially in academia, it is easy to get excited about an idea without properly thinking (or even understanding) its relevance in practice. Whether in academia or industry, I believe it is very important to talk to potential users/customers early and understand their needs before designing a solution. This is related to the concept of design thinking. . Start Small, Scale Quickly . When starting the project, we had tons of interesting ideas and thought of a variety of relevant problem aspects that we wanted to address. Creating an approach from scratch that incorporates all ideas and considers all problem aspects would have been prohibitively complex. Instead, it was important to quickly identify the most important aspects and most promising ideas and simplify everything else. This helped to get started quickly. . Once the simple approach worked, we could extend it to integrate more ideas and address more problem aspects. It is also helpful to have a working prototype at all times: First for the smallest and simplest case, then for more and more complex scenarios. This allows running evaluations for each stage and quantifying progress. Trying to solve everything at once can be overwhelming and makes it difficult to understand the root cause of problems or bugs. Building on something that works already is much simpler, faster, and less error prone. Versioning everything allows going back to previous, working versions if something breaks in between. . Of course, it makes sense to think of a realistic roadmap and architecture at the beginning to have a clear direction and ensure that initial solutions can easily be extended later. . Focus on Just a Few Topics at Once . At the beginning, I was wondering whether I should assign all students working on the project to their own topic or to let them all work on the same topic. The former would allow more parallelization and independent work, thus less dependencies and blocking each other. Still, I found that it was much easier focusing all work on just one or two topics (of course, still with different tasks). Not only did it help drive progress faster, it also allowed more productive meetings and discussions between team members. . While this worked well for my project with 3-4 people, it will likely be different for much larger projects. . Planning is Everything. The Plan is Nothing. . Especially in a research-focused project like RealVNF, there is a lot of uncertainty, e.g., about experiment outcomes, where the outcome of one task affects the next one. This makes mid-/long-term planning very difficult. . I found it useful to have a high-level “storyline” in mind with intermediate milestones, but to frequently adjust it to new insights or results. When interpreting results and adjusting the plan, we always discussed and decided next steps in the group. It is important for motivation to not only understand what a task is about but also why it is relevant. In general, frequent and clear communication within the team was crucial to quickly adapt to new outcomes and avoid wasting time. . Clear, Frequent, and Open Communication Within the Team . Frequent communication with and within the team is crucial. Still, I did not want to waste everyone’s time with unnecessary meetings. For us, weekly group meetings worked quite well. I structured each meeting into status updates, discussion items, and tasks for the next week and tried to limit them to at most an hour. Upcoming tasks need to be communicated very clearly (goal, scope, time) to avoid misunderstandings. Sending out short notes after each meeting helped to keep everyone on the same page. . For an overview of past, current, and upcoming tasks, we also used GitHub issues and project boards (Kanban boards). Additionally, we defined high-level monthly goals/milestones to keep the project a bit more focused. To keep the discussion going during the week and quickly adapt to new experiment outcomes or new insights, we kept in touch via Slack constantly. . We also did individual feedback discussions every now and then, which were really useful. In retrospective, I would do one-to-one meetings more regularly to better understand each team member’s needs and interests. It is important to encourage open communication at all times such that team members say if they have too many or too few tasks. Both is demotivating. At the same time, it can be difficult to estimate how quickly someone will progress with a task. . Finally, while communication and tooling still worked well when working remotely during COVID-19, social meetings were no longer possible. Such social meetings were nice to hang out informally and improve team spirit. . Embrace Bureaucracy . I suppose any bigger project comes with bureaucracy. In my case, I had to communicate with the funding partner and the university’s administration. Sometimes, I was surprised by the amount of rules, formulas, and processes for hiring people, traveling, and buying equipment - even with the money available (i.e., after securing the grant). . As a small anecdote, I tried to hire student research assistants for the project to start with the beginning of the project in November. Unfortunately, this was not possible and I was told that new contracts could not start at the end of a year. I had to wait until January for hiring the students. In January, I was asked why I did not follow my original budget plan and did not spend any money on staff during the first two months (November and December)… . Still, while some rules may be a bit bizarre, all people in the administration were friendly and helpful. I understood that I had to identify the right people to ask and keep asking persistently to eventually understand the rules and get what I needed. . Thank You . Leading this first project was a great experience and an amazing opportunity. I want to thank everyone directly or indirectly involved in the project! Particularly, . thank you to my colleagues at Paderborn University, the project partners at Huawei, and all student research assistants. It was a pleasure to work with you! | thank you to Software Campus, which provided the framework and opportunity for this project! | thank you to the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) for providing funding!

            "title": "Adding a Database to a Django App",
            "content": "Most Django apps store and work with data, e.g., entered by users. Django supports multiple relational databases for persistent storage of such data out of the box. In this blog post, I show how to a database to a Django app. For local development, I use the default SQLite database and for production deployment on Heroku, I use PostgreSQL® 1. . I use the Django “Hello World” App as simple example. I add a button that users can click to say “Hello World!” and count how often it was clicked. The number of clicks is stored in a database and displayed in the app. . The whole process is very simple as Django does most of the work in the background: Creating the database, making the queries, etc. . Requirements . A Django app. For example, the Django “Hello World” App. GitHub repository. This blog post corresponds to release v1.2. | Initial blog post on building and deploying the Django app on Heroku | . | For automated deployment, a free Heroku and GitHub account. | . Defining a Model . Django defines types of data as models. Instances of these models are then saved in a database, where the attributes correspond to the database table’s columns and the instances to the rows. . In this example, I just want to save the value of a counter. I define a counter by a name (in case I want to distinguish multiple counters) and a value in helloworld/models.py: . from django.db import models class Counter(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100) value = models.IntegerField(default=0) def __str__(self): return f&quot;{self.name}: {self.value}&quot; . Saving the Model in a Database . When developing locally, Django automatically creates a SQLite db.sqlite3. To save the new model in the database and create or adjust the corresponding database tables, Django offers simple CLI commands: . python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate . The first command generates the code for making the necessary adjustments to the database. This code is stored in helloworld/migrations and should be committed to git. The second command then applies the adjustments to the database. . Using the Model in the Django App . To integrate the model into the “Hello World” app, I first create a view that handles the interaction with the model. In helloworld/views.py: . from django.shortcuts import render from .models import Counter def index(request): # retriever counter model instance from DB or create it if it doesn&#39;t exist yet counter, created = Counter.objects.get_or_create(name=&#39;hello-world-button&#39;) # increment counter when a POST request arrives (from the button click) if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;: counter.value += 1 counter.save() context = { &#39;clicks&#39;: counter.value, } return render(request, &#39;helloworld/index.html&#39;, context) . This view replaces the previous TemplateView in the app’s URL settings (helloworld/urls.py): . from django.urls import path from . import views app_name = &#39;helloworld&#39; urlpatterns = [ # path(&#39;&#39;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&#39;helloworld/index.html&#39;), name=&#39;index&#39;), path(&#39;&#39;, views.index, name=&#39;index&#39;), ] . Finally, I need to adjust the template to add a button and display the number of times it was clicked (helloworld/templates/helloworld/index.html): . Hello World! ({{ clicks }}x) &lt;form action=&quot;{% url &#39;helloworld:index&#39; %}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt; {% csrf_token %} &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;hello-world-button&quot;&gt;Greet the world!&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; . When running the app, it should now look like this: . . Clicking the button should reload the page and show an increased click count (here, “2x”). The click count should persist even when the app server is restarted or the app is updated. . Of course, this is super slow and just an example for illustrating persistent storage in Django. In production, this should happen asynchronously with some frontend framework. . PostgreSQL® DB on Heroku . The SQLite database used for local development is not suitable for production deployment. To enable persistent storage for my “Hello World” app deployed on Heroku, I use Heroku’s PostgreSQL® database, which is free for such small use cases. . For deployment, Heroku uses by default a free PostgreSQL® database. This database is automatically created when initially setting up the Django app on Heroku. The available databases on Heroku are listed in the Heroku data dashboard. . Screenshot of the Heroku Data dashboard.

            "content": "Google Analytics is the most popular solution to monitor and analyze web traffic. It provides detailed information about users visiting your website or web app - both historically and in real-time. . Here, use the new Google Analytics GA4 to create a &quot;Google Analytics property&quot; for monitoring analyzing the traffic on a Django web app. As simple example app, I build on the previously described Django &quot;Hello World&quot; app. I use WebsitePolicies1 to create a free cookie banner. . The final Django app is deployed on Heroku and available here. The final code is in this this GitHub repository. . Requirements . A Django web app. This post builds on the Django &quot;Hello World&quot; app described in this post. Release v1.1.0 belongs to this blog post. | . | A Google account you can use for Google Analytics. It&#39;s free. | . Creating the Google Analytics GA4 Property . Go to the Google Analytics dashboard and log in if requested. To monitor a new Django app, create a new Google Analytics property by navigating to Admin &gt; + Create Property. . . . Fill in the fields, selecting a property name, region, currency, and information regarding the monitored Django app. . . Once the new property is created, select Data Streams &gt; Web to set up a new data stream for the Django web app. Paste the URL of the Django app: . . Adding Google Analytics to the Django App . Get the code snippet from the created Google Analytics data stream from the created data stream site under Tagging Instructions &gt; Add new on-page tag &gt; Global Site Tag (gtag.js). The snippet should look like this (of course with the real tag ID instead of YOURTAGID): . &lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOURTAGID&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag(&#39;js&#39;, new Date()); gtag(&#39;config&#39;, &#39;YOURTAGID&#39;); &lt;/script&gt; . Copy the code snippet and paste it inside the Django app&#39;s main/base template. In case of my &quot;Hello World&quot; app, there is just a single template, which looks like this: . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOURTAGID&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag(&#39;js&#39;, new Date()); gtag(&#39;config&#39;, &#39;YOURTAGID&#39;); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; Hello World! &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Save, commit, push, and deploy. Google Analytics will likely only work on the deployed app in production. . To validate that it works, open the Django app in Chrome and open developer tools. Opening Application &gt; Cookies should show that the Django app now has cookies used for Google Analytics: . . Opening the Google Analytics realtime dashboard should show that there is a visitor (this may take a few seconds): . . Note: Firefox may block Google Analytics or send &quot;Do-Not-Track&quot; Signals such that visiting the Django app is not recognized or shown in the realtime dashboard. For testing, turn off tracking protection or use Chrome. . Adding a Cookie Banner . Using cookies for Google Analytics legally requires informing users of the Django app of these cookies. If the app does not yet have a cookie banner, it&#39;s now time to create one. . I use WebsitePolicies1 for generating suitable cookie banners. The service is simple and free for non-commercial apps. Simply fill in the questions, and the service generates an HTML snippet to copy and paste into the Django app&#39;s base template (similar to the GA4 tag). .

            "content": "In this guide, I show how to setup a simple Django web app that says &quot;Hello World!&quot; and how to deploy it on Heroku through GitHub. The process is simple enough, but I still kept running into errors when deploying new Django apps, so I thought to finally just write it down step-by-step. . Requirements . For that, Heroku and GitHub accounts are required. Both are free. . All code should be in a GitHub repository. For reference, this link my GitHub repository. The steps described here belong to release v1.0.0. . Django &quot;Hello World&quot; App . Initial Setup . Install Django: . pip install django . Create a new Django project (inside the GitHub repository): . django-admin startproject myproject . A project can consist of multiple apps. Create a new Django helloworld app inside the myproject project: . cd myproject python manage.py startapp helloworld . Run the dev server: . python manage.py runserver . Go to http://localhost:8000/ in the browser. This should confirm the successful initial setup: . . Create the &quot;Hello World&quot; App . Link the helloworld app to the project by adding . &#39;helloworld.apps.HelloworldConfig&#39;, . to the INSTALLED_APPS inside myproject/settings.py. . Create a new HTML-template index.html inside helloworld/templates/helloworld (also create these folders): . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; Hello World! &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . Create helloworld/urls.py to configure a URL path showing the new template: . from django.urls import path from django.views.generic import TemplateView urlpatterns = [ path(&#39;&#39;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&#39;helloworld/index.html&#39;), name=&#39;index&#39;), ] . Finally, link to the helloworld URLs from the project&#39;s myproject/urls.py: . from django.contrib import admin from django.urls import path, include urlpatterns = [ path(&#39;&#39;, include(&#39;helloworld.urls&#39;)), path(&#39;admin/&#39;, admin.site.urls), ] . Now, http://localhost:8000/ should show the dummy &quot;hello world&quot; message: . . Deploying the App on Heroku . Creating a New App on Heroku . To create a new app on Heroku, I log into the Heroku dashboard and select New &gt; Create new app. For the new app, any unique name is ok (I chose django-hello-world-app). . . Note: The name of your Heroku app will also determine its URL, which is &lt;app-name&gt;.herokuapp.com. It can still be changed in the settings later. Next, I select my GitHub repository as deployment method inside Heroku (this may require authorization using GitHub credentials): . . Finally, I have to set some configuration variables (= environmental variables) inside Heroku: Settings &gt; Config Vars &gt; Reveal Config Vars. . Set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to myproject.prod_settings, which is are the settings for production deployment, created later. | Set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY to a randomly generated secret key that is used for deployment. This key must not be commited to the GitHub repository. | . . Preparing Deployment . Before the actual deployment on Heroku, a few additional steps are required. . Currently, the generated folder structure should look like this: . myproject/ helloworld/ myproject/ manage.py . For deployment on Heroku, move everything into the top-level folder such that manage.py is in the project root and there is no more top-level myproject directory: . helloworld/ myproject/ manage.py . The Procfile indicates how to deploy and serve the web app, here with gunicorn: . release: python manage.py migrate --no-input web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi . Accordingly, the dependencies of this &quot;hello world&quot; app are (saved in requirements.txt): . django django-heroku gunicorn . Heroku needs django-heroku for proper deployment (see Heroku docs). . Specify the root path for static files by appending to the myproject/settings.py (also import os): . # Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images) # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/static-files/ STATIC_URL = &#39;/static/&#39; # path to where static files are copied for deployment (eg, for heroku) STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, &#39;staticfiles&#39;) # location of static files in local development: https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-favicon-tutorial # not needed yet, only once adding static files (eg, images) # STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, &#39;static&#39;),] . Create myproject/prod_settings.py with additional settings for production deployment: . &quot;&quot;&quot; Production Settings &quot;&quot;&quot; # default: use settings from main settings.py if not overwritten from .settings import * import django_heroku DEBUG = False SECRET_KEY = os.getenv(&#39;DJANGO_SECRET_KEY&#39;, SECRET_KEY) # adjust to the URL of your Heroku app ALLOWED_HOSTS = [&#39;django-hello-world-app.herokuapp.com&#39;] # Activate Django-Heroku. django_heroku.settings(locals()) . Commit and push everything to the repository&#39;s main branch. . Automated Deployment via GitHub . To test the deployment, go to the Heroku dashboard Deploy &gt; Manual deploy, select the main branch and deploy. After the build and deployment succeeds, click Open app to open &lt;app-name&gt;.herokuapp.com, which should show &quot;Hello World&quot;. Deployment successful! . Finally, enable automatic deploys at Deploy &gt; Automatic deploys &gt; Enable such that the latest version of the Django app is build and deployed automatically with every push to the main branch. . Note: Heroku&#8217;s free dynos are free but power off if they are unused. So loading a deployed app that hasn&#8217;t been used in a while may take multiple seconds. . What Next? .

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
