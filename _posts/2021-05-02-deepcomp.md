In the last year, I have worked a lot on mobility management and cell selection in mobile networks, 
which is most relevant for upcoming 5G networks and beyond.
In this blog post, I try to give a brief, high-level overview of my research, describing what cell selection is,
why it is important, yet challenging. 
I also outline how I solved the cell selection problem with modern self-learning techniques and present some results.

The whole blog post is meant for people who may be interested in this area but do not have a scientific background or 
extensive knowledge in the area.
I refer other people with already advanced knowledge in mobile networks or who are used to reading scientific papers, 
to the preprint of my paper, which contains a lot more details.

Either way, if something is unclear, or you have open questions, feel free to ask them in the comment section below.
For that, you need a (free) GitHub account. Alternatively, you can also contact me directly via Twitter or email.

# What is (multi-)cell selection and why is it important?

We use mobile networks every day, where our phones connect to cell towers nearby to send and receive data.
While there are many influencing factors, we generally have a better signal and higher data rates when we are closer 
to the connected cell tower.
The farther we are away, the worse the signal gets. 
When we are far away from the connected cell tower and in between multiple cells (called "cell edge"), 
the received signal is typically rather bad, which results in low and unreliable data rates.
However, high and reliable data rates are crucial for current and upcoming services like video streaming,
augmented or virtual reality, and cloud gaming.

One option to increase the received data rate, particularly at the cell edge, was introduced in 4G/LTE and is called coordinated multipoint (CoMP).
Among other features, CoMP allows users to connect to and receive data from multiple cells simultaneously.
Compared to previous mobile networks (1G-3G), which only allowed connecting to a single cell, joint transmission from
multiple cells with CoMP leads to significantly higher data rates.
This is illustrated in the figure above for user 5.

In 5G and beyond, joint transmission from multiple cells with CoMP will become increasingly important as users want
higher and higher data rates, and the trend is towards many, small and partially overlapping cells.
Since users move around these cells and cell sizes might be quite small, we need to frequently adjust which users are
connected to which cells, which is called "cell selection".
In CoMP with joint transmissions, users can connect to and receive data from multiple cells, thus I refer to it as 
"multi-cell selection".


# What is the challenge?

Ok, users need to connect to cells and with CoMP, they may connect to multiple cells. What's the problem?
Why not just connect each user to the closest cell? 
Indeed, hat is a common approach for single-cell selection, but it does not leverage the idea of multiple connections with CoMP.
For CoMP, why not simply connect each user to all cells in range or to a specific number of cells?
Again, that is a fair idea, but it may lead to strong competition between users.
Each user connected to a cell requires some resources, e.g., in terms of time and frequency, often called "resource blocks".
Since each cell has a limited amount of these resource blocks, connecting more users to a cell means that fewer resource blocks
are available per user, i.e., these users compete for resources.
In the figure above, users 1-4 are all connected to cell A and compete for resources.

Hence, the challenge of multi-cell selection is ...

The goal is to...
