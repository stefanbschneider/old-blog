Django allows building simple (and complex) web apps quickly, using [Django Templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/) for rendering.
By default, forms, buttons, and other elements are not styled and look quite ugly:

Using Bootstrap and `crispy`, the rendered templates can easily be improved to look much nicer 
- without having to adjust styling manually. For example:

# Installing Bootstrap and `crispy`

# Building a `crispy` Form
