After the Covid outbreak, many conferences and similar events were moved online or into a hybrid format.
For me as researcher, this means that I now only rarely present my research outcomes live in person.
Instead, I record more and more videos of my conferences presentations to share online as part of online conferences.
Some of them are also on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrgDwNoRhA7yHljrc06GjkfmQ9HqybM_a).

I noticed that I tend to use filler words like "uhm", "Ã¤h", "like", etc, which are a lot more 
annoying in recorded and publishded videos than in live presentations.
Of course, I practice my talks before recording, but it is difficult to get rid of bloopers and filler words completely without editing.

Since I am not used to video editing, manually searching for and removing filler words in long presentations would have meant hours of work.
Hence, I searched for some tool to support this editing process and found Descript, which does exactly what I needed:
It can record presentations, converts speech to text, automatically detects and removes filler words, and more.
