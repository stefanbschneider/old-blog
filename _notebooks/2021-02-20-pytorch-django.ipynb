    "## PyTorch Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify uploaded images, I use a [DenseNet neural network](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_densenet/) that is pretrained on the\n",
    "[ImageNet dataset](http://www.image-net.org/).\n",
    "Since the web app is very simple and does not have any other functionality, I simply implement the image classification\n",
    "inside the Django `image_classification/views.py` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This code is taken from a [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/flask_rest_api_tutorial.html) and is under MIT license.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, load the pretrained DenseNet, switch to evaluation/inference mode (since I do not need any further training),\n",
    "and load the mapping for predicted indices to human-readable labels for ImageNet.\n",
    "The JSON-file containing the mapping is available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json)\n",
    "and should be saved in the Django `static` directory under as defined in `STATICFILES_DIRS` (`settings.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import io\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "from torchvision import models\n",
    "from torchvision import transforms\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# load pretrained DenseNet and go straight to evaluation mode for inference\n",
    "# load as global variable here, to avoid expensive reloads with each request\n",
    "model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True)\n",
    "model.eval()\n",
    "\n",
    "# load mapping of ImageNet index to human-readable label\n",
    "imagenet_mapping = json.load(open(\"static/imagenet_class_index.json\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, I need a function to transform an uploaded image (passed in bytes) into the required format for DenseNet,\n",
    "which is a 224 x 224 image with 3 RGB channels. The following code does this transformation and also normalizes the\n",
    "image, returning the corresponding tensor:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def transform_image(image_bytes):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Transform image into required DenseNet format: 224x224 with 3 RGB channels and normalized.\n",
    "    Return the corresponding tensor.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    my_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),\n",
    "                                        transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n",
    "                                        transforms.ToTensor(),\n",
    "                                        transforms.Normalize(\n",
    "                                            [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],\n",
    "                                            [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])])\n",
    "    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image_bytes))\n",
    "    return my_transforms(image).unsqueeze(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, this function can be used inside the prediction function, where the transformed tensor of the uploaded image\n",
    "is passed through the pretrained DenseNet model in a forward pass. Since I only do inference here not training,\n",
    "I do not need a backward pass for backpropagation.\n",
    "The model predicts the index of the corresponding ImageNet class, which is just an integer. To display a more useful\n",
    "label, I retrieve the corresponding human-readable label from the `imagenet_mapping` dict that I created at the\n",
    "beginning from the downloaded JSON file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_prediction(image_bytes):\n",
    "    \"\"\"For given image bytes, predict the label using the pretrained DenseNet\"\"\"\n",
    "    tensor = transform_image(image_bytes)\n",
    "    outputs = model.forward(tensor)\n",
    "    _, y_hat = outputs.max(1)\n",
    "    predicted_idx = str(y_hat.item())\n",
    "    class_name, human_label = imagenet_mapping[predicted_idx]\n",
    "    return human_label\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Django URL setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the PyTorch classification logic implemented in `image_classification/views.py`, I now need to integrate it into\n",
    "the Django app and really use it in a Django view and template.\n",
    "For that, I first make some adjustments in the URLs by creating a separate `image_classification/urls.py` for the URLs\n",
    "of the image classification app:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path, include\n",
    "from django.conf import settings\n",
    "from django.conf.urls.static import static\n",
    "from . import views\n",
    "\n",
    "app_name = 'image_classification'\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    # two paths: with or without given image\n",
    "    path('', views.index, name='index'),\n",
    "] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When visiting the main page of the web app, the requests are now directed to an `index` view, which I need to implement\n",
    "next and which will make use of the previous PyTorch classification logic.\n",
    "Before, I still need link these URLs to the project's URLs in `pytorch_django/urls.py` such that they become effective:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path('', include('image_classification.urls')),\n",
    "    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Django Image Upload, Classification, and Display\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I implement the `index` view, which accepts an uploaded image, processes it, and passes it to the PyTorch\n",
    "classification logic implemented above.\n",
    "I also need a simple Django template to render the web interface, where users can upload an image and submit it for classification.\n",
    "After classification, the template needs to show the predicted label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form\n",
    "\n",
    "For submitting uploaded images, I use a very simply Django form with an `ImageField` in `image_classification/forms.py`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django import forms\n",
    "\n",
    "class ImageUploadForm(forms.Form):\n",
    "    image = forms.ImageField()\n",

    "Here, I just want to display the uploaded image and pass it to the PyTorch model for classification.\n",
    "I do not want to (even temporarily) store it to the file system/disk.\n",
    "Hence, inside the view (`image_classification/views.py`), I get the image from the form, get its byte representation (for PyTorch)\n",
    "and create an image URI for displaying the image in the template later (see [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40568024/2745116)):\n",

    "Basically, deployment requires both a Heroku and a GitHub account (for automated deploys with each new push).\n",
    "After creating the app on Heroku and enabling automatic deploys from the corresponding GitHub repo,\n",
    "set the following config variables (Heroku: Settings > Config Vars):\n",

    "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: pytorch_django.prod_settings\n",
    "DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: <randomly-generated-secret-key>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This indicates that Heroku should use a separate `prod_settings.py` rather than the `settings.py` used for development.\n",
    "This `prod_settings.py` simply overwrites and disables the debug mode, sets the production secret key, and allowed hosts.\n",
    "It also makes use of the `django_heroku` package for further settings.\n",
