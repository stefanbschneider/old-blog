    "\n",
    "> Note: This code is taken from a [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/flask_rest_api_tutorial.html) and is under MIT license.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I load the pretrained DenseNet, switch to evaluation/inference mode (since I do not need any further training),\n",
    "and load the mapping for predicted indices to human-readable labels for ImageNet.\n",
    "The JSON-file containing the mapping is available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/deep-learning-models/image-models/imagenet_class_index.json)\n",
    "and should be saved in the Django `static` directory under as defined in `STATICFILES_DIRS` (`settings.py`).\n",

    "Then, I need a function to transform an uploaded image (passed in bytes) into the required format for DenseNet,\n",

    "I do not need a backward pass for backpropagation.\n",
    "The model predicts the index of the corresponding ImageNet class, which is just an integer. To display a more useful\n",

    "Having the PyTorch classification logic implemented in `image_classification/views.py`, I now need to integrate it into\n",
    "the Django app and really use it in a Django view and template.\n",

    "] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "When visiting the main page of the web app, the requests are now directed to an `index` view, which I need to implement\n",
    "next and which will make use of the previous PyTorch classification logic.\n",
    "Before, I still need link these URLs to the project's URLs in `pytorch_django/urls.py` such that they become effective:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",

    "## Django Image Upload, Classification, and Display\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I implement the `index` view, which accepts an uploaded image, processes it, and passes it to the PyTorch\n",
    "classification logic implemented above.\n",
    "I also need a simple Django template to render the web interface, where users can upload an image and submit it for classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Form\n",

    "Here, I just want to display the uploaded image and pass it to the PyTorch model for classification.\n",
    "I do not want to (even temporarily) store it to the file system/disk.\n",
    "Hence, inside the view (`image_classification/views.py`), I get the image from the form, get its byte representation (for PyTorch)\n",
