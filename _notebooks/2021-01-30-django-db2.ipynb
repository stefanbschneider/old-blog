    "# Defining a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Django defines types of data as [models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/).\n",
    "Instances of these models are then saved in a database, where the attributes correspond to the database table's columns and the instances to the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I just want to save the value of a counter.\n",
    "I define a counter by a name (in case I want to distinguish multiple counters) and a value in `helloworld/models.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Counter(models.Model):\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "    value = models.IntegerField(default=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name}: {self.value}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Saving the Model in a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing locally, Django automatically creates a SQLite `db.sqlite3`.\n",
    "To save the new model in the database and create or adjust the corresponding database tables, Django offers simple CLI commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command generates the code for making the necessary adjustments to the database.\n",
    "This code is stored in `helloworld/migrations` and should be committed to git.\n",
    "The second command then applies the adjustments to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Using the Model in the Django App\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate the model into the \"Hello World\" app, I first create a view that handles the interaction with the model.\n",
    "In `helloworld/views.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.shortcuts import render\n",
    "\n",
    "from .models import Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def index(request):\n",
    "    # retriever counter model instance from DB or create it if it doesn't exist yet\n",
    "    counter, created = Counter.objects.get_or_create(name='hello-world-button')\n",
    "\n",
    "    # increment counter when a POST request arrives (from the button click)\n",
    "    if request.method == 'POST':\n",
    "        counter.value += 1\n",
    "        counter.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "    context = {\n",
    "        'clicks': counter.value,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return render(request, 'helloworld/index.html', context)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This view replaces the previous `TemplateView` in the app's URL settings (`helloworld/urls.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",
    "\n",
    "from . import views\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "app_name = 'helloworld'\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    # path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='helloworld/index.html'), name='index'),\n",
    "    path('', views.index, name='index'),\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I need to adjust the template to add a button and display the number of times it was clicked (`helloworld/templates/helloworld/index.html`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "Hello World! ({{ clicks }}x)\n",
    "\n",
    "<form action=\"{% url 'helloworld:index' %}\" method=\"post\">\n",
    "    {% csrf_token %}\n",
    "    <button type=\"submit\" name=\"hello-world-button\">Greet the world!</button>\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the app, it should now look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](django-db/django-button-clicks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking the button should reload the page and show an increased click count (here, \"2x\").\n",
    "The click count should persist even when the app server is restarted or the app is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is super slow and just an example for illustrating persistent storage in Django.\n",
    "In production, this should happen asynchronously with some frontend framework.\n",
