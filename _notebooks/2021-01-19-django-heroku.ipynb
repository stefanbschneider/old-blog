    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For that, Heroku and GitHub accounts are required. Both are free.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code should be in a GitHub repository.\n",
    "For reference, this link [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/stefanbschneider/django-hello-world).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Create the \"Hello World\" App\n",

    "Link the `helloworld` app to the project by adding\n",

    "'helloworld.apps.HelloworldConfig',\n",
    "```\n",
    "to the `INSTALLED_APPS` inside `myproject/settings.py`.\n",

    "Create `helloworld/urls.py` to configure a URL path showing the new template:\n",

    "    manage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "For deployment on Heroku, move everything into the top-level folder\n",
    "such that `manage.py` is in the project root and there is no more top-level `myproject` directory:\n",
    "```\n",
    "helloworld/\n",
    "myproject/\n",
    "manage.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Procfile` indicates how to deploy and serve the web app, here with `gunicorn`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "release: python manage.py migrate --no-input\n",
    "web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the dependencies of this \"hello world\" app are (saved in `requirements.txt`):\n",
    "```\n",

    "To test the deployment, go to the Heroku dashboard `Deploy > Manual deploy`, select the `main` branch and deploy.\n",
    "After the build and deployment succeeds, click `Open app` to open `<app-name>.herokuapp.com`, which should show \"Hello World\".\n",
    "Deployment successful!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, enable automatic deploys at `Deploy > Automatic deploys > Enable` such that the latest version of the Django app is build and deployed automatically\n",
    "with every push to the `main` branch.\n",
